Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example 1:


Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Example 2:


Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
