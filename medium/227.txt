Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces  . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:


Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7


Example 2:


Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1

Example 3:


Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5


Note:


	You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
	Do not use the eval built-in library function.
