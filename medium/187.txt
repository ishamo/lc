All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:


Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
