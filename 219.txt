Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.


Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true



Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
